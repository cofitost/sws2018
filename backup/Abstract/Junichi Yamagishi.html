                <h3>Abstract :</h3>
                <p>Voice conversion (VC) is a technique to transform the speaker identity included in a source speech waveform into a different one while preserving linguistic information of the source speech waveform. VC has great potential in the development of various new applications such as a speaking aid for individuals with vocal impairments such as dysarthric patients, a voice changer to generate various types of expressive speech, novel vocal effects of singing voices, silent speech interfaces, and accent conversion for computer assisted language learning.
                        In this talk, I introduce the Voice Conversion Challenge 2018, designed as a follow up to the 2016 edition with the aim of providing a common framework for evaluating and comparing different state-of-the-art voice VC systems. As an update to the previous challenge, we considered both parallel and non-parallel data to form the Hub and Spoke tasks, respectively. A total of 23 teams from around the world submitted their systems, 11 of them additionally participated in the optional Spoke task.
                        A large-scale crowdsourced perceptual evaluation with 267 subjects was then carried out to rate the submitted converted speech in terms of naturalness and similarity to the target speaker identity. From the results, we have seen the incredible progress that has come to the field with the rise of new speech generation paradigms such as Wavenet. We observed that one of the submitted VC systems obtained an average of 4.1 in the five-point scale evaluation for quality judgment and about 80% of its converted speech samples were judged to be the same as target speakers by listeners.

                <p>Junichi Yamagishi received the Ph.D. degree from Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2006 for a thesis that pioneered speaker-adaptive speech synthesis. He is currently an Associate Professor with the National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan, and also a Senior Research Fellow with the Centre for Speech Technology Research, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, U.K. Since 2006, he has authored and co-authored more than 180 refereed papers in international journals and conferences. He was the recipient of the Tejima Prize as the best Ph.D. thesis of Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2007. He was awarded the Itakura Prize from the Acoustic Society of Japan, the Kiyasu Special Industrial Achievement Award from the Information Processing Society of Japan, and the Young Scientists’ Prize from the Minister of Education, Science and Technology, the JSPS prize in 2010, 2013, 2014, and 2016, respectively. He was one of organizers for special sessions on “Spoofing and Countermeasures for Automatic Speaker Verification” at Interspeech 2013, “ASVspoof evaluation” at Interspeech 2015, “Voice conversion challenge 2016” at Interspeech 2016, and “2nd ASVspoof evaluation” at Interspeech 2017. He has been a member of the Speech and Language Technical Committee. He was an Associate Editor of the IEEE/ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO, SPEECH, AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING and a Lead Guest Editor for the IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING special issue on Spoofing and Countermeasures for Automatic Speaker Verification.</p>
